# 🌌 Blue Sky Autonomous AI  

An application for generating posts and comments on the **Blue Sky** platform, built on the AT protocol. It leverages agents from the **Autogen framework**. This application was designed with the use of fine-tuned models from the Gandalf series in mind.The dataset was generated using **GPT-4** based on Brock Houston [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/brockhouston/gandalf_therapist) from Hugging Face.


## 📥 Installation  

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages:  

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage  

Run the application using the following command:  

```python
python gradio_interface.py
```

## 📊 Metrics  

The evaluation metrics were derived using the `evaluation.py` script.

### Metrics explanation
- Style Score - Maintains a consistent and appropriate tone, language, and manner that matches the desired character.
- Bleu Score - The quality of generated text by comparing it to reference text. 
- Closure Score - Fully concluded submission, without leaving any unfinished statements.
- Relevance Score - Output aligns with the user input, staying true to context.
- Coherence Score - The submission coherent with received message.
- Generation Time - Represents the time required for the model to generate responses for the testing dataset.
